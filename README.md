# [Meliag](https://www.gijs6.nl/meliag)

From Latin _**meli**us **ag**men_ meaning _better train_ (I hope :D)

Just a website I built to display all kinds of data about trains in a better way.

Data from the [NS API](https://apiportal.ns.nl/) and (maybe in the future from [NDOV](https://ndovloket.nl/))?

## Ideas / stuff to add

### Stuff/features to add / stuff to fix

- [] Images on the map
- [] Map data (only the data for each _ritnummer_ ophalen every 5 minutes or so and that data saving seperatly and combining the coordinate data so that is doesn't take ages)
- [] Filters on the map (materieel)
- [] More info in popup (map)
- [] Station info in popup

### Pages to add

- [] Departing / arriving times (per station) + images
- [] _Spoorkaart_ with _SpoorKaart API_ (+ disruptions?)
