# [Meliag](https://www.gijs6.nl/meliag)

From Latin _**meli**us **ag**men_ meaning _better train_ (I hope :D)

Just a website I built to display all kinds of data about trains in a better way.

Data from the [NS API](https://apiportal.ns.nl/) and (maybe in the future from [NDOV](https://ndovloket.nl/))?

## Ideas / stuff to add

### Stuff/features to add / stuff to fix

- [ ] Images on the map
- [ ] Filters on the map (_materieel_ and other stuff)
- [ ] More info in popup (map)
- [ ] Station info in popup (current station & stations en route?)
- [ ] Fixing _ritnummer_-data for the map (combining with _treintijden?_)
- [ ] Adding some better styles to the _treintijden_
- [ ] Adding images and more info to the _treintijden_
- [ ] Fix and combine the _ritnummer_-data for the _treintijden_ and the map

### Pages to add

- [x] Departing / arriving times (per station) + images/drawings (of the trains (so that the _materieel_ clear is))
- [ ] _Spoorkaart_ (the rail lines) with _SpoorKaart API_ (+ disruptions?)
