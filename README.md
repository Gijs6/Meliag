# Meliag

From Latin ***meli**us **ag**men* meaning *better train* (I hope :D)

A website I am building to display all kinds of data about trains in a 'better' way.

Built with the *amazing* Python framework [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) and the [Jinja](https://github.com/pallets/jinja) templating engine.

Data from the [NS API](https://apiportal.ns.nl/).

## Run yourself

If you want to run the site yourself, just clone this repo, install all the required packages via `pip install -r requirements.txt` and run `py main.py` (`flask --app main run` also works, but that could be with some diffrent settings). You can then visit the site at `localhost:9000` (or another link, the correct link will be printed in the terminal).
